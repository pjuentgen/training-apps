# Containerization & Deployment Summary

## ✅ What We've Created

### 🐳 **Docker Configuration**
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with OpenJDK 17, security hardening, and health checks
- `.dockerignore` - Optimized build context excluding unnecessary files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup with nginx reverse proxy
- `nginx.conf` - Reverse proxy configuration for load balancing

### 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline** 
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Complete GitHub Actions workflow with:
  - Automated testing and test reporting
  - Multi-architecture Docker builds (AMD64/ARM64)
  - Security scanning with Trivy
  - Automatic deployment to staging/production
  - SBOM generation for supply chain security

### ☸️ **Kubernetes Manifests**

#### Base Configuration (`k8s/base/`)
- `deployment.yaml` - Application deployment with ingress, service, and namespace
- `configmap.yaml` - Configuration and secrets management
- `hpa.yaml` - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Pod Disruption Budget
- `rbac.yaml` - Security policies, service accounts, and network policies

#### Environment Overlays
- `k8s/staging/` - Staging environment with reduced resources (2 replicas, 256Mi memory)
- `k8s/production/` - Production environment with high availability (5 replicas, 1Gi memory)

### 🛠️ **Deployment Tools**
- `deploy.sh` - Intelligent deployment script supporting multiple environments
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### Security
- ✅ Non-root user execution
- ✅ Read-only root filesystem
- ✅ Capability dropping
- ✅ Network policies
- ✅ RBAC configuration
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning

### Scalability
- ✅ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (CPU/Memory based)
- ✅ Pod Disruption Budget for high availability
- ✅ Resource requests and limits
- ✅ Multi-replica deployment

### Observability
- ✅ Health checks (liveness/readiness probes)
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ Metrics endpoints
- ✅ Container health checks

### DevOps Best Practices
- ✅ Multi-stage builds
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations
- ✅ Automated testing
- ✅ Security scanning
- ✅ Kustomize for configuration management

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### Local Development
```bash
# Build and run locally
./deploy.sh --environment local

# Or use docker-compose directly
docker-compose up -d
```

### Staging Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh --environment staging
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh --environment production
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Automated tests run on every PR
3. Staging deployment on push to `develop` branch
4. Production deployment on push to `main` branch or release

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Update Configuration**:
   - Change `YOUR_USERNAME` in deployment.yaml to your GitHub username
   - Update domain names in ingress configurations
   - Configure TLS certificates

2. **Set up Secrets**:
   - Add `KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING` and `KUBE_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` to GitHub secrets
   - Configure any application-specific secrets

3. **Test Deployment**:
   - Test locally with `./deploy.sh --environment local`
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Validate all endpoints and functionality

Your Spring Boot application is now fully containerized with enterprise-grade deployment capabilities! 🎉
